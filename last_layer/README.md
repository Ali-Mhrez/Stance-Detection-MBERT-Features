# Results: Using Last Layer Features

In this experiment, we utilized the final layer of the pre-trained Multilingual BERT model to extract semantic and syntactic features from the input text. These features were then fed into Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures to perform Stance Detection.

The results obtained from this setting provide insights into the effectiveness of leveraging the high-level representations captured by the final layer of BERT.
